# Image Classification - Cats and Dogs

This project implements a binary image classification model using ResNet18 in PyTorch to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained from scratch (no pre-trained weights) and evaluated using a structured pipeline.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Kaggle Animal Dataset (Filtered: Only Cats & Dogs).
- **Preprocessing:** Images resized to 64x64 and converted to grayscale.
- **Model:** Custom ResNet18 with modified input/output layers.
- **Training:** Implemented with CrossEntropyLoss & Adam Optimizer.
- **Evaluation:** Logs loss & accuracy using TensorBoard.
- **Testing:** Saves test metrics and prediction results persistently.
- **Visualization:** Training metrics are visualized using TensorBoard.

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepanshtripathi/ResNet-Image-Classification.git
cd image_classification
```
### **Important Notes**
- **The trained model (`best_model.pth`) and the raw dataset (`data/raw/`) are NOT included in this repository.**
- **You will need to:**
  1. **Download the dataset manually** and place it inside `data/raw/`.
  2. **Train the model** using `train.py` to generate `checkpoint/best_model.pth`.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.10 is installed. Then install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Preprocess the Dataset
Ensure your raw dataset is inside `data/raw/`, then run:
```bash
python image_classification/utils/dataset.py
```
This will:
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Resize them to 64x64.
- Save processed images in `data/processed/`.

### 4. Train the Model
Run the training script:
```bash
python image_classification/models/train.py
```
This will:
- Train the model on the dataset.
- Save logs in `logs/tensorboard/` for TensorBoard visualization.
- Save the best model in `checkpoint/best_model.pth`.

### 5. View Training Results in TensorBoard
Start TensorBoard to monitor loss & accuracy:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/tensorboard
```
Open [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/) in your browser.

### 6. Test the Model
Evaluate model performance on the test dataset:
```bash
python image_classification/models/test.py
```
Results will be saved in `logs/test_metrics.csv`.

### 7. Run Predictions on New Images
Use the trained model to classify a single image:
```bash
python image_classification/models/predict.py
```
Enter the path to an image, and it will return:
- **Predicted Class:** "Cat" or "Dog"
- **Confidence Score**
- Saves the prediction in `logs/predictions.csv`.

## Dataset & Preprocessing
The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs. Images undergo:
- **Grayscale conversion** (to reduce complexity).
- **Resizing to 64x64 pixels** (to ensure consistent input shape).
- **Normalization** using `mean=0.5`, `std=0.5`.

---

## Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** ResNet18
- **Input Layer:** Modified to accept 1-channel grayscale images instead of 3-channel RGB.
- **Output Layer:** Adjusted for binary classification (**Cat = 0, Dog = 1**).

## Challenges Encountered & How They Were Resolved
### Choosing the Learning Rate
- **Issue:** Finding an optimal learning rate for training stability.
- **Solution:** `0.001` was chosen based on common best practices for Adam optimizer, which yielded good results.

### Ensuring Data Preprocessing Consistency
- **Issue:** Preventing mismatches between training and testing images.
- **Solution:** Standardized grayscale conversion & normalization.

### Setting Up TensorBoard for Monitoring
- **Issue:** Ensuring proper logging for loss and accuracy.
- **Solution:** Integrated TensorBoard and saved all metrics.

### Persistent Saving of Predictions & Metrics
- **Issue:** Ensuring results were not lost after running scripts.
- **Solution:** Created structured logging for:
  - `logs/training_metrics.csv`
  - `logs/test_metrics.csv`
  - `logs/predictions.csv`

## Final Notes
- All training & test logs are stored persistently.
- TensorBoard provides an interactive way to analyze results.
- The model achieves high accuracy without pre-trained weights.
- **Potential future improvements:** Different architectures, Hyperparameter tuning.
